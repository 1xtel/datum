# datum : "scrap your boilerplate" for Erlang

> You could do this with a macro, but...
> ...the best macro is a macro you don't maintain

**datum** is a pure functional and generic programming for Erlang. It had its origins in [Purely Functional Data Structures](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf) by Chris Okasaki, on implementing a various higher rank functional abstarctions and patterns, on dealing with [scrap your boilerplate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/scrap-your-boilerplate-with-class/) and gaining expereince from other functional languages. The library is still testsing the limits of functional abstractions in Erlang.
